# Photo Utils

> A collection of Python utilities to organize photos and other media

## Why?

I have a very large photo library the is primarily stored in Google Photos (synced from my phone) and on external SSDs. Over the years, this collection has got messy, and every time I want to sync from Google photos to my drive, it's very difficult

### Key Problems to Solve

- De-duplication of media files
- Correct the dates on files downloaded in bulk from Google Photos
- Consistently name files for better organization and sorting

## Usage

The main entrypoint for usage is the CLI which you can access by running

```zsh
python cli.py --help
```
